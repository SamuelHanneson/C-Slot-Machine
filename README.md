This is my first excursion into C++ I watched a bit of a youtube tutorial and have just been figuring out functions as I need them, currently trying to implement throwing errors if the user inputs something other than a number for the games they would like to play and other than Y/y/N/n for the would you like to continue screen

Current Version = 1.1

The main function of this program is to let the user play a small slot machine game, it will prompt the user to enter how many games they would like to play, run that number of games and then ask if the user would like to continue playing, the program runs until the user enters N to the prompt asking if they wish to continue playing, prints a final record and closes the terminal window.
