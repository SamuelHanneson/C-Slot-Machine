Version 1.1 - Fixed bugs:
  - Program now runs until it recieves a N/n input on the would you like to continue prompt
  - Tracks wins/loss record
  - Prints final record at the end but no goodbye message
  - 
  Need to fix still:
  - Final goodbye message
  - Crashes program if Y/N not input
  - Implement error messages

V1 - could only run a maximum of 2 loops before terminating the program, program fails to print goodbye message
